# LeetCode

## Usage
### Step 1
First, try to solve a problem by yourself. If you can't solve it in 5 minutes, look at the answer. If you understand the answer, hide the answer and write the code by yourself. If you can't write the code in 5 minutes, look at the answer again. If you look at the answer, delete all the code and start over. If you submit the answer and it is accepted, you have completed the first step.

### Step 2
Next, make the code as readable as possible. If you submit the answer and it is accepted, you have completed the second step.

### Step 3
Next, delete all the code and start over. This time, measure the time and write the code again. If you submit the answer and it is accepted, delete all the code and start over. If you can write the code without any errors within 10 minutes for 3 times in a row, you have completed the third step.
